Welcome to Blathers' Blabber! Here you'll find the best animal ratings in town! Come one, come all, and see all our amazing animals on display. Then rate them. Wahoo!

Blathers is a character from a popular video game Animal Crossing by Nintendo. In the game, he owns a museum where he collects and researches various critters and wildlife.

Help Blathers explore the local wildlife and collect data for his museum! With this app, you can add an animal to be reviewed, leave a review for an existing animal,
and upvote/downvote a review to say whether it was helpful or not.

This app is built using React on Rails and Postgres.
